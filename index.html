      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am currently the kitchen manager for a popular cafe, but after many years of working in the food and beverage industry, I'm ready to take the next step in my life.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I hail from Brevard, North Carolina</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My interests include playing guitar, collecting vinyl, reading about ancient history, and cooking with my girlfriend.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I would like to work as a systems security expert or a web developer.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in a very small house in my hometown of Brevard, nestled in the mountains of western North Carolina.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've had a fascination with computers since I was very young, when I would spend days throwing random commands at my parents' DOS-based Tandy, just to see what would happen. The fascination eventually took hold and grew over the years until i found myself wanting to create some of these programs and pages to fit my needs.</p>
